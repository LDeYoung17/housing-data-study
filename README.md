# Study of New York Housing Data

<h2>Summary</h2>

This project is for an externship to create a customer service chatbot. It is trained on data from Stack Overflow, specifically questions about Python. It uses models from SentenceTransformer and Llama2, then leverages ConversationalRetrievalChain in order to generate Question/Answer responses. The UI was built using Chainlit and deployed initially on Google Colab. After that, I created a Docker image and then deployed on AWS.
